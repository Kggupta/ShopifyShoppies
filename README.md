# The Shopify Shoppies

This project is based off an old shopify front-end developer challenge.

It allows the user to search for films using the OMDB API and 'nominate' them.

You can nominate up to 5 movies.

## Implementation Details

This app features a GraphQL server to interface with the OMDB API, and Apollo to cache the searches.

The nominations are all persisted with Redux so you can close the page and your selections will be saved.
